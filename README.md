📊 Data QA & Cleaning Framework Using Python

A lightweight, extensible system for validating, cleaning, and auditing CSV datasets.

🚀 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Data Quality & QA Automation Framework designed for real-world data validation and cleaning tasks.
It demonstrates how to build a scalable, reusable, and automated data quality workflow using Python, Pandas, and Regex.

The system processes raw CSV data, applies multiple validation rules, flags inconsistencies, and returns cleaned output — making it ideal for:

Data Analysts

Data Quality / Data Operations Analysts

QA Engineers working with data workflows

Anyone working with CSV-based or ETL data pipelines

⭐ Key Features

🧪 3. Modular QA Rules Engine

A reusable Python module that contains configurable QA checks, making it easy to extend with new rules.

▶️ 4. Demo Runner Script

demo_run.py executes all cleaning + validation steps and prints a clean summary of:

Passed checks

Failed checks

Problematic rows

Cleaned output sample
